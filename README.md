# Music Mixer Assignment
Made by David Gonzales and Juliette Thomson<br><br>

This is a soundscape dedicated to the legendary West 4th St. basketball courts - called, 'The Cage'. <br>
This is a spot where David visits everytime he goes to New York, and wanted to capture this experience in the assignment.<br>
It is based on a moment David has resting in his memory, reimagining the sounds that fully immersed him in the concrete jungles of New York City.<br><br>
