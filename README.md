# Music Mixer Assignment
Made by David Gonzales and Juliette Thomson

This is the basic framework for our Music Mixer assignment. We plan to take a picture of the downtown core of London from a high point, and then organize the SVG's inside the image. When all of the MP3 elements are playing, the page will sound like a soundscape of a city.

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

### assets
Contains PDF file of simple wireframe to show how content will be organized on both a 780 and 1280 width format. Also includes Link to a 
"city soundscape" website that has a community based on making urban soundscape experiences. 

### images
Contains 6 SVGs that will represent the MP3s we can drag and drop, and a pause/play button

### includes
6 MP3's that will be played in the music mixer

### Code (Under contruction)
So far, barely any functionality has been included in the code.
I have set the content down in the HTML, but they are not in anyway organized and only used to test how the content will look beside eachother.
